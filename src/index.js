// Users can "create projects"
// Users can "create tasks"
// Projects have todo-items/tasks

    // Todo-items will have following properties:
        // Title
        // Description
        // Due date
        // Priority
        // OPTIONAL: Notes
        // OPTIONAL: Checklist



// UI
    // View all projects
    // View all tasks in each project
        // Expand a single task to see/edit its details
        // Delete a todo

// Store data in localStorage
    // Function to "save tasks to localStorage" everytime a new project/tasks is created
    // Function to "fetch tasks from localStorage" when the app is first loaded
        // Avoid "crashing" if requested data from localStorage doesn't exist
        // NOTE: localStorage uses JSON to send and store data
            // NOTE: Funtions CANNOT be stored in JSON
                // Figure out how to add methods back to the fetched object properties
